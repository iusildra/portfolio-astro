        The "Canne de Combat" is a French martial art (of which I'm particularly fond of) where we fight with a "canne" (hence the name ðŸ˜„). Historically, it was a mean of defense. The standard length is 95cm and the weight between 90-130g for tournament canes, and up to 200g for training ones.
      </p>
      <p>The most common way of fighting is with a single cane (and lots of protection, fencing helmet, padded clothes...), but there are some funny variants that I do practice a bit:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>"Double canne": one cane in each hand</li>
      <li>"Canne chausson": single cane with French boxing kicks. It can also be done with 2 canes, but then it's getting hard to parry kicks ðŸ˜…</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There's also the "BÃ¢ton de combat" where instead of a cane we use a staff (140cm length, 400g weight). Unfortunately (or not) there are no tournament for this one as it's too dangerous (one hit can bend a fencing helmet)</p>
