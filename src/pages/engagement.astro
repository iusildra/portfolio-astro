    There are globally a few reasons I chose to actively participate in the organization of conferences, with some of them being:
    <ul>
      <li>I enjoy giving a hand</li>
      <li>It makes people happy (to have a conference to attend)</li>
      <li>
        On the D-day we need to run everywhere, that's exhausting but at the same time so satisfying when everything goes smoothly
      </li>
      <li>
        It should help me develop organizational skills (though I'm not sure it has had an effect yet...)
      </li>
      <li>
        Just breaking a ü§¨ comfort zone to stop being afraid when interacting with other people (there's still some work to do here üôÉ)
      </li>
    </ul>

        SunnyTech is a local, yearly tech conference of about 550 people with various subjects: Back/Front end, AI, Data, Cloud, Security, Mobile, etc., depending on the current year's trends
      </p>
      <p>
        I started with the communication group (one of the best ‚ù§Ô∏è) in the first year, before slowly trying to be active in other groups (like the speakers, sponsors, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
        It's quite funny to see the progression: at first, I asked for confirmation before sending any post on social media. Now I can just review it to avoid errors and send it right away üí™

        Contrary to SunnyTech, ScalaIO is a conference mostly oriented towards Scala, with some talks about other functional programming languages (especially OCaml). We ran 2 editions of around 100 people each in 2024.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the Nantes edition in 2024, I rewrote the website from a starting point initiated by a former organizer starting in Dec. 2023, at the same time as a big school project.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was the very first UI I had to create almost from scratch with few existing components, with real usage (and not to be thrown away once it ends). I surprised myself when I saw the amount of CSS line changes one year later ‚ú®

        I always enjoyed explaining things to others. So I
        started with a 3-hour course about Scala & parser combinators in Nov. 2024 (the story is quite funny actually)
      </p>
      <p>
        Then as I gratuated I offered myself to take on a part of the course we had about Scala & functional programming as these are what I'm the most
        fluent with. It would be the introduction (basics of FP and Scala), so that the next teacher can follow up with more advanced topics to show
        real world usage (e.g. effect systems)
      </p>
      <p>
        My "first students" will be people with whom I hang out and drink some beers, that's kinda funny to think about
