    <h1>Conferences</h1>
    There are globally a few reasons I chose to actively participate in the organization
    of conferences, with some of them being:
    <ul>
      <li>I enjoy giving a hand</li>
      <li>It makes people happy (to have a conference to attend)</li>
      <li>
        On the D-day we need to run everywhere, that's exhausting but at the
        same time so satisfying when everything goes smoothly
      </li>
      <li>
        It should help me develop organizational skills (though I'm not sure it
        has had an effect yet...)
      </li>
      <li>
        Just breaking a ü§¨ comfort zone to stop being afraid when interacting
        with other people (there's still a lot of work to do here...)
      </li>
    </ul>

        SunnyTech is a local, yearly tech conference of about 550 people with
        various subjects: Back/Front end, AI, Data, Cloud, Security, Mobile,
        etc., depending on the current year's trends
      </p>
      <p>
        I started with the communication group (one of the best ‚ù§Ô∏è) in the first
        year, before slowly trying to be active in other groups (like the
        speakers, sponsors, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
        It's quite funny to see the progression: at first, I asked for
        confirmation before sending any post on social media. Now I can just
        review it to avoid errors and send it right away üí™

      <p>
        Contrary to SunnyTech, ScalaIO is a conference mostly oriented towards
        Scala, with some talks about other functional programming languages
        (especially OCaml). We ran 2 editions of around 100 people in 2024.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the Nantes edition in 2024, I rewrote the website from a starting
        point initiated by a former organizer starting in Dec. 2023, at the same
        time as a big school project.

        It was the very first UI I had to create almost from scratch with few
        existing components, with real usage (and not to be thrown away once it
        ends). I surprised myself when I saw the amount of CSS line changes one
        year later ‚ú®
