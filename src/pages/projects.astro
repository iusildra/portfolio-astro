        I've already started a few portfolio projects, but I don't think I ever
        got close to having one single complete page ðŸ˜…. ScalaIO's website
        helped me in filling in the lack of knowledge I had in CSS
      </p>
      <p>
        After having tested <InlineCode>Vue</InlineCode> in some school project (I
        find it interesting, even though I didn't used TS at that time [what a mistake])
        and being fed up with <InlineCode>React</InlineCode> (+/- did the same webiste
        several times), I wanted to try something new and heard of the "templating
        frameworks" not long ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I picked Astro ðŸš€ (mainly because we already have a few Svelte
        components at work and I had good echoes about it)
      </p>
      <p>
        Just putting the preview & link below for consistency with the layout,
        but I don't think it's necessary ^^

        I took on the rewrite of the Scala.IO website using <a
          href="https://www.scala-js.org">Scala.js</a
        > and <a href="https://laminar.dev">Laminar</a>. The website is deployed
        on <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/fr/home/">Clever Cloud</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thankfully, the base layout (header, cards) and color choices had
        already been implemented, otherwise, with my inability to choose one
        tone and stick to it (though it seems better now with this website ðŸ˜„)
      </p>
      <p>
        The design and data model have been revisited a few times in order to
        increase maintainability (thanks to other orgs' help and insights)
        and/or when I discovered better ways to do things. Among the noticeable
        changes:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Markdown content instead of code-oriented data storage (we don't
            want to add a database)
          </li>
          <li>Switch from relational to document data model</li>
          <li>
            <InlineCode>grid-template-areas</InlineCode> instead of custom alignment
            for schedule's tracks (<a
              href="https://github.com/ScalaIO/scala.io/pull/177">GitHub PR</a
            >)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        I won't dare saying that I can be a UI/UX designer, but given the
        starting point, I'm quite happy with the result ðŸ˜„

        The implementation of the Debugger Adapter Protocol (DAP) for VS Code.
        Basically, what runs when starting a debug session in Scala with VS Code

        I started working on this project during a past <a
          href="/experiences#scala-center-internship"
        >
          internship at the Scala Center</a
        >. I had an amazing time being able to work 100% on this open-source
        project
      </p>
      <p>
        I really learned a lot there and discussed very technical & specific
        concepts that were super interesting. It was refreshing to be able to
        dive deep into a subject, instead of just scratching the surface
      </p>
      <p>
        A bit sad not to have the time anymore, with all the conferences, sports
        & other activities, but I'll manage to find some time to contribute
        again
